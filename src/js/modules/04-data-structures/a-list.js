/**
 * A list is a nested set of objects,
 * with the first object holding a reference
 * to the second, the second object holding
 * a reference to the third, and so on.
 *
 * Write a function arrayToList that builds up
 * a data structure like the previous one when
 * given [1, 2, 3] as an argument, and write a
 * listToArray function that produces an array
 * from a list.
 *
 * Also write the helper functions prepend, which
 * takes an element and a list and creates a new
 * list that adds the element to the front of the
 * input list, and nth, which takes a list and a
 * number and returns the element at the given position
 * in the list, or undefined when there is no such element.
 *
 * If you havenâ€™t already, also write a recursive version of nth.
